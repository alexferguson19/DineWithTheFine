        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
FOR THE CHEESECAKE FILLING<br></br>

Line a small cookie sheet with parchment paper.<br></br>

Add the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla to a small bowl. Mix on medium-high speed with an electric mixer until fluffy and the sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes.<br></br>
6 oz (170 g) cream cheese, cold, 3 tbsp (38 g) granulated white sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla<br></br>
Scoop the cheesecake filling into 18, 2 tsp portions onto the baking sheet. Slightly flatten each scoop with the back of a spoon so each resembles a thick disc rather than a scooped ball.<br></br>
Pop them into the freezer until completely frozen.<br></br>

FOR THE RASPBERRY JAM<br></br>

Add the frozen raspberries and sugar to a medium pot over medium heat.<br></br>
340 g frozen raspberries, hulled and finely diced, 1/4 cup (50 g) granulated white sugar<br></br>
Cook for about 45 minutes, smashing half way through with a wooden spoon. Be sure to stir continuously towards the end of the time as the jam will start sticking to the bottom of the pan as it gets thicker.<br></br>
The strawberry jam should be very thick and reduced to a heaping 1/3 cup (80 ml).<br></br>
Remove from the heat and pop in the fridge to chill while working on the dough.<br></br>

FOR THE COOKIES<br></br>

Preheat the oven to 350℉ (175℃). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.<br></br>
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Then set aside the flour mixture.<br></br>
2 3/4 cups (344 g) all purpose flour, spooned and leveled  , 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt<br></br>

In a large bowl cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together with an electric hand mixer on high speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes.<br></br>
(You can also use the bowl of a stand mixer fit with a paddle attachment.)<br></br>
1 cup (200 g) granulated white sugar, 1 cup (227 g) unsalted butter, very softened<br></br>
Add in the egg and vanilla and mix on medium speed until pale in color and very fluffy, about 1-2 minutes.<br></br>
1 egg, at room temperature, 2 tsp vanilla<br></br>
Add in the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed just until combined.<br></br>
Push 3/4 of the dough to the side of the bowl. Flatten out 1/4 of the dough on the bottom of the bowl. Spoon 1/4 of the jam onto that section of dough. Add 1/4 of the dough on top of that section and spoon 1/4 of the jam on top. Repeat twice more. <br></br>(Basically, we are trying to evenly disperse the jam!)<br></br>
"Cut" the dough in quarters with a rubber spatula and fold each section of dough just until the jam is slightly folded in. Don't mix the jam in all the way, you'll want there to be little pockets of jam throughout the dough.<br></br>
Scoop the dough into 18 portions with a 2 tbsp cookie scoop. Slightly flatten out each then place a frozen cheesecake disc in the center. Then close the cheesecake in with the cookie dough. Make sure the cheesecake is completely covered in cookie dough. <br></br>
Shape each cookie dough section into a slightly flattened disc, rather than a ball.<br></br>
(The cookie dough does not spread as well if not slightly flattened.) See photos in the blog post above.<br></br>
1/4 cup (50 g) granulated white sugar, for rolling dough in<br></br>
Roll the cookie dough in sugar.<br></br>
(Keep the cheesecake balls in the freezer until ready to use for each batch of cookies.)<br></br>

Transfer the cookie dough to a prepared baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake 6 cookies at a time for 11-12 minutes.<br></br>
(When the cookies are straight out of the oven, scoot a large circular cookie cutter around them to give them a perfect circular shape.)<br></br>
Let the cookies cool for about 10 minutes on the cookie sheet, then transfer the baked cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely. Then serve!   <br></br>
